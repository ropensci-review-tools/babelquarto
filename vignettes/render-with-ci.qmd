If you want to render and publish your multilingual book or website with CI, you must render your project with `render_book()` or `render_website()`, respectively.
Don't use Quarto's own render and publish steps.
You can find more information about publishing with CI in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/ci.html).

### Site URL

When you render a project in a CI context, you need to set the URL of the publishing website in an environement variable.
You can do that with the `BABELQUARTO_CI_URL` environment variable.

### Steps for rendering

To render your project with CI, you need to follow these general steps:

* Install the necessary dependencies including Quarto and R dependencies
* Render you project using {babelquarto}'s `render_book()` or `render_website()` functions
* Publish the rendered HTML (_site or _book folder) where you deploy your project (a GitHub pages branch, Netlify, etc.)

## Example

Here's an example of how you could render a multilingual book with CI using GitHub Actions:

[Babelbook](https://nenuial.github.io/babelbook/) and [source code](https://github.com/Nenuial/babelbook).
